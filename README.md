## Bring confidential smart contracts to your blockchain with fhEVM

There used to be a dilemma in blockchain: keep your application and user data on-chain, allowing everyone to see it, or keep it privately off-chain and lose contract composability.
Thanks to a breakthrough in homomorphic encryption, Zamaâ€™s fhEVM makes it possible to run confidential smart contracts on encrypted data, guaranteeing both confidentiality and composability.

## Zamaâ€™s fhEVM enables confidential smart contracts using fully homomorphic encryption (FHE)

- End-to-end encryption of transactions and state
- Composability and data availability on-chain
- No impact on existing dapps and state

<p align="center"><img width="816" alt="encrypted" src="https://github.com/zama-ai/fhevm/assets/1384478/6b70af9d-6790-4dad-826c-eba09dc80d8b"></p>

## Developers can write confidential smart contracts without learning cryptography

**Solidity Integration:** fhEVM contracts are simple solidity contracts that are built using traditional solidity toolchains.

**Simple DevX:** Developers can use the euint data types to mark which part of their contracts should be private.

**SC-defined ACL:** All the logic for access control of encrypted states is defined by developers in their smart contracts.

You can take a look at our [examples](/examples)!

## Powerful features available out of the box

- **High Precision Integers -** Up to 256 bits of precision for integers
- **Full range of Operators -** All typical operators are available: +,-,*,/,<,>.==,...
- **Encrypted If-Else Conditionals -** Check conditions on encrypted states
- **On-chain Secure Randomness -** Generate randomness without using oracles
- **Configurable Decryption -** Threshold, centralized or KMS decryption
- **Unbounded Compute Depth -** Unlimited consecutive FHE operations

## Install

```bash
# Using npm
npm install fhevm

# Using Yarn
yarn add fhevm

# Using pnpm
pnpm add fhevm
```

## Usage

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: BSD-3-Clause-Clear

pragma solidity >=0.8.13 <0.8.20;

import "fhevm/lib/TFHE.sol";

contract Counter {
  euint32 counter;

  function add(bytes calldata encryptedValue) public {
    euint32 value = TFHE.asEuint32(encryptedValue);
    counter = TFHE.add(counter, value);
  }

  function getCounter(bytes32 publicKey) returns (bytes memory) {
    return TFHE.reencrypt(counter, publicKey);
  }
}
```

See our documentation on [https://docs.zama.ai/fhevm/solidity/getting_started](https://docs.zama.ai/fhevm/solidity/getting_started) for more details.

## Development Guide

Install dependencies (Solidity libraries and dev tools)

```bash
npm install
```

Note: Solidity files are formatted with prettier.

### Generate TFHE lib

```
npm run codegen
```

WARNING: Use this command to generate Solidity code and prettier result automatically!

Files that are generated now (can be seen inside `codegen/main.ts`)

```
lib/Common.sol
lib/Precompiles.sol
lib/Impl.sol
lib/TFHE.sol
contracts/tests/TFHETestSuiteX.sol
test/tfheOperations/tfheOperations.ts
```

### Tests

The easiest way to understand how to write/dev smart contract and interact with them using **fhevmjs** is to read and explore the few tests available in this repository.

<br />
<details>
  <summary>Fast start</summary>
<br />

```bash
# in one terminal
npm run fhevm:start
# in another terminal
npm i
cp .env.example .env
./scripts/faucet.sh
npm test
```

</details>
<br />

#### Docker

We provide a docker image to spin up a fhEVM node for local development.

```bash
npm run fhevm:start
# stop
npm run fhevm:stop
```

#### Faucet

To use a ready to use test (only for dev) wallet first, prepare the .env file that contains the mnemonic.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

This allows the developer to use a few accounts, each account can get coins:

```bash
npm run fhevm:faucet:alice
npm run fhevm:faucet:bob
npm run fhevm:faucet:carol
```

#### Run test

```bash
npm test
```

<br />
<details>
  <summary>Error: insufficient funds</summary>
<br />

Ensure the faucet command is successful.

</details>
<br />

### Adding new operators

Operators can be defined as data inside `codegen/common.ts` file and code automatically generates solidity overloads.
Test for overloads must be added (or the build doesn't pass) inside `codegen/overloadsTests.ts` file.
